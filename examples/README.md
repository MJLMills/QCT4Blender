# Rendering Examples

This directory contains examples in both .top and .blend format which can be used to check the reading and rendering of Blender respectively.
The .blend files can be loaded without needing to install the Rhorix software.
The following lists the included examples by name, corresponding figure in the [Rhorix paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319407440_Rhorix_An_interface_between_quantum_chemical_topology_and_the_3D_graphics_program_f) and the QM/QCT codes used to generate the data.
