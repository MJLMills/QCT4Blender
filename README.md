# AIM For Blender
#### Matthew J L Mills

This is a [Blender](http://www.blender.org) Add-On (i.e. a script that extends Blender with extra functionality) that allows the user to read files containing topological objects defined by the [Atoms in Molecules](http://www.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/bader/) theory and convert them to 3D scenes. Subsequently the full functionality of Blender can be used to render these objects.
The code was written with reference to Chapter 4 of the WikiBook '[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro#Table_of_Contents/)' and the appropriate section of the [Blender documentation](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/). Version 2.69 of Blender was used in the development.
Full documentation will be provided in 'Manual.pdf'.
