# AIM For Blender
#### Matthew J L Mills

This is a [Blender](http://www.blender.org) *Add-On* (i.e. a script that extends Blender with extra functionality) that allows the user to read files containing topological objects defined by the theories of [Quantum Chemical Topology](http://www.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/bader/) and convert them to 3D scenes. Subsequently the full functionality of Blender can be used to render these objects.
The code was written with reference to Chapter 4 of the WikiBook '[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro#Table_of_Contents/)' and the appropriate section of the [Blender documentation](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/). Version 2.69 of Blender was used in the development.

Full documentation will be provided in 'Manual.pdf'.

######Using the Program
<p>
There are two options for using the script. 
<br>The more permanent solution is to put the script into your Blender user preferences directory, which will cause it to appear in the Add-Ons list in the User Preferences window. To activate it you must tick the checkbox for that entry. You can then save the configuration for all future documents.
<p>
The other option is to store the script in a text block within your Blender document. This has to be added to each document you make so is less desirable unless you intend to make changes to the script. This allows for quick editing and reloading of the script.
<p>
Irrespective of the method, the script will add a panel to the Tool Shelf of the 3D View when in Object Mode.

**Note**: This program does not work yet!
