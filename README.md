# QCT4Blender
Matthew J L Mills

This is a Blender[1] Add-On (i.e. a script that extends Blender with extra functionality) that allows the user to read files containing topological objects defined by the Atoms in Molecules[2] theory and convert them to 3D scenes. Subsequently the full functionality of Blender can be used to render these objects.
The code was written with reference to Chapter 4 of the WikiBook[3] 'Blender 3D: Noob to Pro' and the appropriate section of the official Blender documentation[4]. Version 2.69 of Blender was used in the development.
Full documentation will be provided in 'Manual.pdf'.
